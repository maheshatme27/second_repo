1.write a shell script to Execute free command, read the specified column from user and pass this variable to function.

#!/bin/bash
f1(){
free -m
}
f2(){

value1=$(free | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}')
echo total ram is $value1
value2=$(free | awk 'NR==2 {print $3}')
echo used ram is $value2
sum=$(( $value1-$value2 ))
echo total unused mem is $sum
}
f1
f2


2.Create a file with size 10 mb in every min,for 15 mins
at 16th min print all files names into a log file then delete all files and folder.
Explain the functionalities in details .

vi 1.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "create files"
fallocate -l 10M /home/ubuntu/shell/task/shtask
vi 2.sh
#!/bin/bash
mv 1.sh log
vi 3.sh
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf log
create a crontab
crontab -e
add
15 * * * * /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/shell/task/shtask/1.sh
16 * * * *  /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/shell/task/shtask/2.sh
16 * * * * /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/shell/task/shtask/3.sh


3.Create a shell script which will look for the free memory every time ,
 if free memory is less than 50% , then print the current memory & time into the log file and restart the system .

#!/bin/bash
f1(){
value1=$(free | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}')
echo total ram is $value1
value2=$(free | awk 'NR==2 {print $3}')
echo used ram is $value2
sum=$(( $value1-$value2 ))
echo total unused mem is $sum
perc=$(( $value2 * 100 / $value1 ))
echo percentage of used $perc
if [ 50 -lt $perc ]
then
echo "current mem"
else
echo "restart"
fi
}
f1


5.Create a job for 'cron' and create a job for 'crontab' separately.
what is the difference between cron and crontab?
Specify where cron and crontab will be used?

cron job <path>
Create a new crontab file, or edit an existing file. $ crontab -e
cron is the utility on the server
Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended
crontab is a file which contains the time intervals 
crontab It allows to use job scheduler, which is known as cron to execute tasks


6.write a shell script to print below(tree) structure.

#!/bin/bash
rows=5
for (( i=1;i<=rows;i++ ))
do
        for (( j=1;j<=rows-i;j++ ))
do
        echo -n " "
done
for (( j=1; j<=2*i-1; j++ ))
do
echo -n "-"
done


7.In function script, call only disc free method and append that into a file.
try to execute that script in the folder where u created the program.
come out and also execute outside the dir,
then go to root directory and execute,
total 3 files created in 3 different locations..but need to create only one file wherever you execute the script.

#!/bin/bash
f1free () {
free
}
disc () {
du -h
}
discfree () {
df -h >> /home/ubuntu/shell/tsk.txt
}
unamef () {
uname
}
psfun () {
ps -aef
}
topfun () {
top
}
grepfun () {
echo " hi error this program " >  new.txt
grep -o error new.txt
}
discfree

hi
